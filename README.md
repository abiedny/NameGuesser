# NameGuesser
## Welcome, Greta
A 'lil widget to guess the name of my aunt and uncles soon to be born baby, given
a set of clues in the form of alphabet blocks.

Calculates all possible combinations of letters than can be created with the blocks (5 blocks, each with 2 letters, only one active at a time)
Then, inputs all possible cominations of letters as an array of character arrays into function to calculate all possible permutations of one set of letters. Repeats until every possibility is tested.

For each possibility, the resulting string is tested to see if it is in a scraped list of several thousand female baby names. If it is that name is printed out.

**7/13/18**:
Only one possibility was found: Greta.
